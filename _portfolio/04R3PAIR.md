This website I created to experiment with **three.js**,
**tailwindcss**, and **vite**. three.js allows for 3D objects to be 
rendered in real time inside of your browser!
I created a simple 3D scene with
a cube that you can rotate and click on. You can use your arrow
keys or the on-screen buttons to rotate move throughout the page.
Try using the up and down arrow keys to zoom in and out!
