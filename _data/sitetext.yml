        desc: "Upon entering High School, I knew that I wanted to deepen my knowledge of computers. 
        Fortunately, my school allowed me to take 
        computer science courses through a local technical college during my sophomore year, which enabled me to 
        obtain college credits early. My school then offered their own computer science courses my junior year. 
        After I had completed all their provided computer courses, I received special permission from 
        the principal to take AP 
        Computer Science as an independent study.
        I was awarded the **Computer Academic Excellence Award** by the Principal of Union Grove High School."

        sales associate before my performance led to me being hired for a part-time position. By the end of my time
        on the sales floor, I was equipped with enough knowledge of the store and their products to inform and navigate the customers
        towards their best solution."

        I was eager to extend my knowledge and skills as part of that team. As part of the Geek Squad, I learned what
         it was like to be on the other end of a sale and
        how the customers were interacting with their technology. I gained familiarity with diagnosing customer
        computers and assisting in the improvement of their user experience."

    body: "I am entering my senior year at UW-Parkside as a Computer Science major, while also pursuing a minor in Web Development. 
    I have always been extremely interested in technology and have dedicated much of my free time to exploring various

    goals. My passion for learning and problem solving extend to my personal life as well. In my free time, I enjoy tackling new hobbies and mastering new skills.
    Recently, I have been building custom keyboards and computers for commission as well as advancing my knowledge of repairing and enhancing motor vehicles."
