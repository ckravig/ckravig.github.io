        computer science courses through a local technical college when I was a sophomore, which allowed me to 
        get college credits early. UGHS then offered computer science courses of their own my junior year. 
        After I exhausted them of their computer courses I then asked the principal for permission to take AP 
        Computer Science as an independent study which was approved.
        I was awarded the **Computer Academic Excellence Award** by the Principal of Union Grove High School."

        opened up I knew I wanted to apply. I learned what it was like to be on the other end of a sale and
        how the customers are interacting with their technology. Learning about how to diagnose a customers
        computer and how you can help improve their user experience along the way was a great skill to obtain."
