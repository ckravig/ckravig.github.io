        desc: "Upon entering High School, I knew that I wanted to deepen my knowledge of computers. 
        Fortunately, my school allowed me to take 
        computer science courses through a local technical college during my sophomore year, which enabled me to 
        obtain college credits early. My school then offered their own computer science courses my junior year. 
        After I had completed all their provided computer courses, I received special permission from 
        the principal to take AP 
        Computer Science as an independent study.
        I was awarded the **Computer Academic Excellence Award** by the Principal of Union Grove High School."

        sales associate before my performance led to me being hired for a part-time position. By the end of my time
        on the sales floor, I was equipped with enough knowledge of the store and their products to inform and navigate the customers
        towards their best solution."

        I was eager to extend my knowledge and skills as part of that team. As part of the Geek Squad, I learned what
         it was like to be on the other end of a sale and
        how the customers were interacting with their technology. I gained familiarity with diagnosing customer
        computers and assisting in the improvement of their user experience."
